QUESTION 1: What is 125 + 347?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
125 + 347 = 472.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 472</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 2: What is 15 × 12?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
15 × 12 can be broken down into 15 × 10 + 15 × 2.
15 × 10 is equal to 150.
15 × 2 is equal to 30.
So, 15 × 12 is equal to 150 + 30, which is equal to 180.
Therefore, 15 × 12 is equal to 180.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 180</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 3: What is 144 ÷ 12?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
To divide, we need to remove one factor from the dividend.
In this case, we can divide 12 by 12 to get 1.
Now we can divide 144 by 1 to get 144.
So, 144 ÷ 12 is equal to 12.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 12</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 4: Solve: 2x + 5 = 13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.
We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation: 2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5.
Simplifying, we have 2x = 8.
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: 2x/2 = 8/2.
Simplifying, we have x = 4.
So the solution to the equation is x = 4.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 4</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 5: Solve for y: 3y - 7 = 14
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
To solve for y, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
First, we add 7 to both sides to get rid of the -7 on the left side:
3y - 7 + 7 = 14 + 7
3y = 21
Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for y:
y = 21/3
y = 7
So the solution to the equation is y = 7.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 7</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 6: If 5x = 45, what is x?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 5.
So, x = 45/5 = 9.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 9</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 7: A train travels 240 km in 4 hours. What is its speed?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
To find the speed of the train, we need to divide the distance traveled by the time taken.
The distance traveled is 240 km and the time taken is 4 hours.
So, the speed of the train is 240 km / 4 hours = 60 km/h.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 60</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 8: Sarah has 24 apples. She gives 1/3 to her friend. How many apples does she have left?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
Sarah has 24 apples.
She gives away 1/3 of them, which is 24 * (1/3) = 8 apples.
So Sarah has 24 - 8 = 16 apples left.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 16</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 9: A rectangle has length 8 cm and width 5 cm. What is its area?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.
So, the area of this rectangle is 8 cm × 5 cm = 40 cm².
</reasoning>
<answer>: 40</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 10: What is the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair die?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
A fair die has 6 faces, and only one of them is a 6.
So, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 1/6</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 11: If you flip a coin twice, what is the probability of getting two heads?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
There are two possible outcomes for each coin flip: heads or tails.
Since we are flipping two coins, there are 2² = 4 possible outcomes in total.
We want to find the probability of getting two heads.
The only outcome in which we get two heads is heads, heads.
So, there is only one outcome in which we get two heads.
Therefore, the probability of getting two heads is 1/4.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 1/4</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 12: What are the common symptoms of diabetes?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar (glucose).
Common symptoms include:
- Increased thirst and frequent urination
- Extreme hunger
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue and weakness
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing sores or frequent infections
- Tingling or numbness in hands and feet
</reasoning>
<answer>: Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and tingling in extremities.</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 13: What causes high blood pressure?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
High blood pressure (hypertension) can be caused by various factors:
1. Lifestyle factors: Poor diet (high sodium, low potassium), lack of physical activity, obesity
2. Genetic factors: Family history of hypertension
3. Age: Risk increases with age
4. Medical conditions: Kidney disease, thyroid problems, sleep apnea
5. Other factors: Stress, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption
</reasoning>
<answer>: High blood pressure is caused by lifestyle factors (poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity), genetics, age, certain medical conditions, stress, smoking, and excessive alcohol.</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 14: If all cats are animals, and Whiskers is a cat, what can we conclude?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
This is a classic syllogism in logic.
Premise 1: All cats are animals.
Premise 2: Whiskers is a cat.
Using deductive reasoning:
If all members of category A (cats) belong to category B (animals),
and X (Whiskers) is a member of category A (cats),
then X (Whiskers) must also be a member of category B (animals).
</reasoning>
<answer>: Whiskers is an animal.</answer>

================================================================================
QUESTION 15: What comes next in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESPONSE:
<reasoning>
Let me analyze the pattern:
2 × 2 = 4
4 × 2 = 8
8 × 2 = 16
Each number is multiplied by 2 to get the next number.
This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.
So, 16 × 2 = 32.
</reasoning>
<answer>: 32</answer>
