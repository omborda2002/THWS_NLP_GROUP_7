# Capstone Project: NLP Social Matching

## 🎯 Project Overview

An AI-powered social matching application that uses Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze user profiles and determine compatibility between users.

## 🔗 Repository

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/marinam34/nlp_social_matching](https://github.com/marinam34/nlp_social_matching)

## 📌 Status

🔄 **Currently in Development**

## 💡 Core Idea

The application leverages NLP to:
- Analyze user-generated text (bios, interests, responses)
- Extract semantic meaning and personality traits
- Match users based on compatibility scores computed through NLP embeddings

## 🛠️ Technologies & NLP Concepts Used

*(Utilizing at least 4 ideas from the course)*

1. **Text Embeddings** - Semantic representation of user profiles
2. **Similarity Metrics** - Cosine similarity for matching
3. **Transformers** - Pre-trained models for text understanding
4. **Fine-tuning** - Domain adaptation for matching tasks
